Research Activities:
My research interests relate to the molecular pathology of diabetic complications and in particular kidney disease in diabetes. Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of kidney failure in Canada. My laboratory is committed to finding new treatments to slow or even reverse the progression of kidney disease. Our research is truly translational, studying the cellular processes involved in the development of the cardiovascular complications of diabetes and investigating the action of novel therapies both in vitro and in vivo. Through this, we hope to bring new treatments directly from the bench to the bedside. My research is focused on the critical role of high blood pressure in the progression of kidney disease and I am studying new ways to stimulate endothelial regeneration, the repair of the small blood vessels, damaged due to diabetes.

Skeletal muscle atrophy, ubiquitin ligases
Selected Publications
Research Activities:
I am a new investigator at St. Michael's Hospital and am establishing my laboratory. My research interests involve delineation of the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle atrophy. Muscle atrophy is a key determinant of mortality in end stage lung disease such as COPD, and a significant contributor to morbidity associated with many diseases such as COPD, pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. The predominant manner by which muscle protein is broken down is via ubiquitin proteasome mediated degradation: using a rat model of skeletal muscle atrophy we have identified several ubiquitin ligases that may be involved in the development of muscle atrophy, including for example, Nedd4. We are currently mapping the intracellular signaling networks engaged by these ligases that result in the loss of muscle mass and studying cohorts of patients with COPD and PHT to determine which known mediators of muscle atrophy identified in rodent models are actually active in the muscles of patients. Identification of mediators of muscle atrophy in patients will allow the development of interventions that can complement rehabilitation to significantly improve patient function, independence and well being.

Selected Publications
Research Activities:
I am using the power of large population-based data sources to evaluate the long-term consequences of cancer care for cancer survivors, moving beyond descriptive studies. I have been funded through an Early Researchers Award funded by the Government of Ontario and the Canadian Institutes for Cancer Research to evaluate long-term survivorship issues in young adults with cancer. In collaboration with scientists at the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences, I will be using cancer-registry data, administrative data, and primary data collection and plan the most comprehensive evaluation of survivorship ever conducted in this group of patients.
I am also interested in cancer screening; recently, I used Ontario data sources to evaluate the effectiveness of colonoscopy for the prevention of colorectal cancer mortality in the population using case-control methodology. This work, funded through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, has produced exciting findings: while colonoscopy appears highly effective for the prevention of cancer death from left sided colorectal cancers, the effectiveness appears to be greatly reduced for right sided cancers. I plan further studies using data available at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Studies supplemented by primary chart abstraction to understand this dramatic finding. We are now performing a case control study comparing patients who had a "missed" cancer at colonoscopy to those who had cancer detected at colonoscopy, work funded through the American College of Gastroenterology.

Selected Publications
Research Activities:
My research interests involve the development, testing and interpretation of patient-based instruments, both outcomes and predictors. I conduct head-to-head comparisons of different instruments' performance in a given setting (i.e. longitudinal comparison of quality of life measures), do qualitative studies to discern the meaning of a concept such as "recovery" to a patient so that we can learn how to measure that concept well, and work on projects to bring the meaning of these scales and concepts into clinicians' hands (i.e. point of care reporting of prognostic profiles). My background is as an occupational therapist in hand and upper limb reconstruction, so I have a keen interest in upper extremity function and am one of the lead scientists supporting the DASH (disabilities of the arm shoulder and hand) Outcome Measure.

Currently I have funded studies evaluating the measurement of patterns of at-work difficulties (at-work productivity loss) in persons with arthritis, and similarly in injured workers where we are developing feedback prognostic profiles.

The application of measures and scales has led me to become involved in how we can deliver immediate feedback to the fracture clinic team to aid in the identification and treatment of osteoporosis in the patient with a fragility (low trauma) fracture. In collaboration with Osteoporosis Canada we have used tablets to collect, collate and feedback information in 33 fracture clinics across the province. Recently we received team development funding for a network of multidisciplinary clinics supporting the care and rehabilitation of injured workers and are beginning to work on the infrastructure of that network.

Selected Publications
Research Activities:
My primary research interest is in mechanical ventilation utilization. I have developed a program of research focusing on characterizing the existence and magnitude of practice pattern variation in weaning critically ill adults from invasive mechanical ventilation, on national and international levels, using rigorous survey methodology: within this research program, I conducted a three-month prospective observational study of mechanical ventilation discontinuation practices. In collaboration with colleagues in the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group, I am currently conducting an eight-centre, pilot randomized controlled trial comparing an automated weaning protocol (computerized program that automates weaning from invasive ventilation) to a paper-based weaning protocol implemented by intensive care clinicians.

As a meta-analyst, I have conducted research to establish the role for pressure and volume-limited mechanical ventilation strategies in the management of patients with acute lung injury and the adult respiratory distress syndrome and exploring the role for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in weaning critically ill adults from invasive ventilation and as an adjuctive treatment for patients with congestive heart failure. As a trialist, I have explored the role of N-acetylcysteine in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery and in at risk critically ill patients undergoing contrast enhanced computed tomograms. As a methodologist, I am working to develop the field of survey methodology and have prepared a series of articles for health care practitioners outlining an approach to developing, testing, administering, and reporting high quality questionnaires.

Together with colleagues in the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group, I will be leading a 26-centre prospective observational study to describe the current process of procuring consent in critically ill adults and identifying factors that predict whether substitute decision makers decline or provide consent for critically ill patients to participate in critical care research studies.

Surgical options for patients with end-stage ankle arthritis include ankle fusion or arthroplasty. It is still not clear which of these options is best for the patient. I currently have one of the largest prospective data banks on patients that are surgically managed for ankle arthritis. This data bank includes pre-operative and annual post-operative validated outcome questionnaires. In addition, over 80 patients have undergone a pre-operative and one year post-operative gait analysis. This database will answer many of these questions over the next decade.
I have been the one of the primary persons to organize a multi-centered data base on Surgical management of end-stage ankle arthritis. This database is located in Halifax and involves over six centers. There are over 600 patients registered and it is the largest prospective database on this topic in the world.
I am a primary investigator in a prospective trial comparing the outcomes of first MTPJ fusion vs. arthroplasty. This study has reached its endpoint and will be the first of it kind presented and published.
In summary, my current clinical work and studies are at the cutting edge internationally and continue to support St. Michael's Hospital goal as a leading innovator in the clinical management of the sick and injured.

Research Activities:
My major research interest is acute lung injury. This can be caused by either biomolecular or biophysical insults to the lungs, such as an infection or the mechanical injury resulting from mechanical ventilation itself. My lab is dedicated to understanding the interaction between patients and the breathing machine and finding new ways to identify individuals, who are at higher risk for developing lung injury, diagnose, treat and monitor improvement from injury. To accomplish our goals, we have developed various model systems from basic epithelial cell stretch models to animal models of lung injury. We exploit whole genome approaches, such as microarray technology, to identify novel molecular targets and use various computational strategies to analyze our data. We are also interested in understanding how and why critically ill patients develop multi-organ failure. To answer some of the more complex questions my lab also collaborates actively with clinical researchers involved in state of the art clinical trials related to novel mechanical ventilation strategies.

Selected Publications
Research Activities:
My research is concerned with the social and economic determinants of health and urban health inequities. My work on socio-economic dimensions of housing and health is concerned with identifying the social and economic attributes of housing which may affect a variety of health outcomes. I have two quasi-experimental studies of the impact of subsidized housing on health currently in progress: one is investigating the impact of the demolition and reconstruction of Regent Park, one of Canada's oldest and largest public housing developments, on adult mental health and child development, and the second concerns the provocative hypothesis that in the affluent societies of the world, places with a more unequal distribution of income have poorer overall health status, even after adjustment for the absolute wealth of the population. Since 1999, I have been collaborating on a large program of research investigating this hypothesis in North American cities and currently plan to extend this work to other countries. The third major emphasis in my research, for which I was awarded a five-year chair in applied public health by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Public Health Agency of Canada is on the ways in which residential neighbourhood socio-economic conditions shape health status. My particular focus is on how and to what extent interventions in neighbourhoods, such as the Regent Park Redevelopment or the City of Toronto's Priority Neighbourhoods Strategy, may affect health and reduce health inequites. The emphasis of this work is on adult mental health, healthy body weights and healthy child development.
The questions I work on straddle the sub-disciplines of health geography and social epidemiology primarily, but a number of other disciplines are also influential, including environmental psychology, sociology, psychiatric epidemiology, developmental psychology. I strive to conduct research that is theoretically informed and informative, empirically rigorous and innovative, and both policy and community relevant.

My major research focus is looking at neurobehavioural symptoms in dementia and their neuropsychological correlates. Most of my work to date has focused on delusions and the extent to which they may be linked to abnormal cognitive functioning in the elderly. In addition, I have done some work looking at the use of cognitive enhancers in unique populations (such as the inner city) and the extent to which response may be linked to cognitive reserve. Finally, I have an interest in health systems issues as they apply to the elderly.

Selected Publications
Research Activities:
My lab has two major research foci:
1. The biology of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process underlying tissue fibrosis. Our goal is to understand how normal epithelial cells (particularly of the kidney) transform into matrix-producing (scar-forming) invasive and contractile myofibroblasts. Our major interest is to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms whereby injury of the intercellular contacts leads to EMT. This basic research allows insight into fundamental mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of major disease entities such as kidney and lung fibrosis and liver cirrhosis.
2. Signaling in osmotic stress and cell volume regulation. Normal volume and water content is vital for every cell. We investigate how dehydration and the corresponding cell shrinkage initiate adaptive responses that include reinforcement of the cell structure (cytoskeleton), remodeling of organelles, activation of ion transport processes and osmosensitive genes. We examine how volume-dependent signaling results in adaptation and survival or, in severe cases, a programmed cell death. This basic research helps elucidate how cells cope with stress conditions, which occur in a variety of disease states, including diabetes, dehydration, trauma and heart failure.

Infectious diseases are emerging faster than at any other time in human history. At the same time the world is becoming a much smaller place. Today more than two billion passengers board commercial flights every year creating unprecedented opportunities for local infectious disease threats to rapidly transform into international epidemics that threaten global health, security, and economic prosperity. Furthermore, the mass migration and resettlement of millions of immigrants and refugees around the world today requires novel approaches to identify and treat potentially serious infectious diseases that enable immigrants to achieve their full potential and concurrently minimize risks to public health.

Research Interests:
Nutrition/vitamins/folate and colorectal and breast cancers, cancer prevention, pharmacogenetics of cancer therapy, nutrigenomics, epigenetics of cancer, development and validation of surrogate endpoint biomarkers of cancer
Research Activities
Research Activities:
My research focuses on several aspects of nutrition and cancer at the molecular, cellular and translational levels, including prevention, early detection and screening, development and validation of surrogate endpoint biomarkers, molecular genetics and epigenetics, pharmacogenetics, and nutrigenomics using animal models, cell culture systems and human subjects. My research program represents the integration of epigenetic, molecular and cellular biology, molecular epidemiology, cancer biomarkers, and nutritional biochemistry in animal and in vitro models.
Prevention: My laboratory has been investigating the effects of  nutritional/dietary factors and potential chemopreventive agents on the development of colon, breast, and pancreatic cancers using animal models and human subjects. Using animal models and cell culture systems, my laboratory has also been investigating fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms by which nutritional and dietary factors can modify the risk of cancer.  A comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the preventive effect of nutritional and dietary factors is crucial in designing and implementing rational, effective and safe strategies for cancer prevention using these factors. Another area of cancer prevention research in my laboratory is the development of appropriate animal models of nutrition-mediated colon cancer by genetic engineering.
Early detection and screening: My group has been developing and validating potential cellular, molecular, epigenetic and biochemical markers of colon cancer that can be used as an endpoint of human prevention trials and as a predictor of colon cancer risk in humans.  Eventually these potential biomarkers can be utilized as a screening tool to identify individuals at high risk of developing colon cancer for early diagnosis and aggressive preventive strategies.  My group has also been evaluating special diagnostic technologies for identifying individuals harboring premalignant changes in the colon and those at high risk of developing colon cancer. 
Molecular genetics: My laboratory has been investigating how subtle genetic variants (i.e., single nucleotide polymorphism [SNPs]) in several key genes involved in the absorption, metabolism and excretion of nutrients and dietary factors modify colon cancer risk in animal and cell culture models.  A comprehensive understanding of these molecular variants is essential in identifying individuals at risk of developing colon cancer for aggressive screening and preventive strategies. My group has also been examining how these molecular variants interact with nutrients and dietary factors in modifying colon cancer risk. The nutrient-gene interactions in the development and prevention of colon cancer is one of the most exciting and important emerging areas of colon cancer and nutrition research. 
Treatment (pharmacogenetics): My research also focuses on identifying and characterizing molecular and cellular markers (genetic variants in nutritional metabolic pathways) that can predict the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy using state-of-the-art molecular biologic techniques in cell culture and animal models. This area of research is called "pharmacogenetics" and is important in providing safe and effective customized chemotherapy to patients with cancer by considering genetic variations in the metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents.
Nutrigenomics/nutrigenetics: My research also focuses on clarifying differential expression patterns of genes that are involved in nutrition-mediated cancer development and treatment as well as on identifying novel gene(s) that are mechanistically related to these processes using gene expression profiling.

Research Activities:
Our interest focuses on translational research in pulmonary and microvascular physiology and pathophysiology, in that we aim to integrate basic research on cell signalling and communication pathways to the level of the intact organ and organism. This approach allows us to identify new basic pathomechanisms in complex disease models such as acute lung injury, lung edema, or pulmonary hypertension. We then aim to apply this knowledge for the development and preclinical testing of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these diseases.
A special methodological focus of our work is the use of intravital microscopy and real-time fluorescence imaging techniques in intact organs or life animal models, which we combine with both cell and molecular biology techniques as well as physiological measurements.

Research Activities:
My work involves learning the intricacies of the immune system in order to better understand autoimmune diseases such rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile diabetes and multiple sclerosis. I am particularly focused on immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a condition characterized by low platelets, which are particles in the blood that are important in the process of blood clotting. Disorders affecting platelets can lower the amount of platelets in the blood and put patients at risk of bleeding.

I am examining IVIg, a therapeutic product that suppresses various autoimmune conditions such as ITP. IVIg is the current treatment for ITP but is expensive, not well understood, and available only in limited supply and carries a risk of transmitting viral diseases. It also does not work well in some autoimmune diseases (eg, SLE).

My team and I are having success in determining how IVIg suppresses ITP, and by uncovering IVIg's mechanism of action, a replacement treatment may be developed that will be less costly, in continuous supply and free of viral disease. We have discovered a replacement for IVIg to treat some autoimmune disorders in animal models (ITP & inflammatory arthritis) and we hope to be testing new therapies in human clinical trials within the next three to five years.

My research interests centre on two areas:
Understanding the cellular and molecular basis of microvascular endothelial barrier function.  In particular, my lab is interested in how the permeability of the microvasculature increases during infections or inflammatory conditions such as sepsis: we investigate this using a combination of live cell imaging, electron microscopy, and traditional biochemical and molecular biological approaches.
			Understanding how Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis, is able to resist killing by the human immune system.  This involves the generation of mutants of Mtb with targeted genetic deletions and the testing of these mutants for susceptibility to oxidative and nitrosative stress.  We are also interested in understanding how Mtb is able to persist inside a human macrophage, which is normally an intensely antimicrobial environment.

Research Interests:
Platelet physiology, platelet transfusion, platelet apoptosis
Selected Publications
Research Activities:
My research interests are related to two major areas. The first research program is application of flow cytometry and animal models in platelet physiology and platelet transfusion studies. My lab contributed to the mathematical analysis of flow cytometric data which allows us (i) to determine the density of platelet markers per platelet surface area, (ii) quantify and standardize measurements of binding of anti-platelet antibodies and (iii) assess the sensitivity of different flow cytometric parameters for evaluating platelet activation status in agonist-stimulated platelet populations and determining platelet quality and function in human platelet concentrates stored for transfusion; (iv) two animal (rabbit) models have been established in my laboratory for determining viability and hemostatic function of human platelets after transfusion. The second research program is investigation of nuclear-independent cell apoptosis in anucleate cells, platelets. We found that platelet apoptosis is a phenomenon that can be triggered by diverse stimuli, including human thrombin, calcium ionophores, anti-platelet antibodies, immobilized vascular collagens, high shear stresses and prolonged storage of platelets for transfusion. These stimuli trigger platelet apoptosis by impacting on several apoptotic targets in mitochondria, cytosol and plasma membrane. We also demonstrated that apoptosis can be induced both in fluid-phase and adherent platelets and thrombi-like aggregates.

Research Activities:
My CIHR-funded laboratory studies the cellular mechanisms that regulate the survival of inflammatory neutrophils by modulating an endogenous apoptotic program. We have shown that neutrophils from patients with sepsis persist in an activated state for a prolonged period of time, and study both neutrophils from septic patients, and neutrophils from healthy volunteers that have been stimulated in vitro with inflammatory mediators. We have identified two key novel mechanisms that delay neutrophil apoptosis or programmed cell death. First, sepsis and experimental inflammation result in upregulation of the gene for Pre-B Cell Colony-Enhancing Factor (PBEF), also known as visfatin; PBEF is necessary for delayed apoptosis. Second, the apoptotic enzyme, caspase-8, can be tyrosine phosphorylated, and phosphorylated caspase-8 is resistant to activation and so apoptosis does not proceed. Caspase-8 tyrosine phosphorylation is increased in septic patients. 
		

I also have an active interest in clinical trials in the critically ill, as the co-principle investigator of the CHAT trial – an international pilot study of the efficacy of statins in patients with severe H1N1 disease.

Selected Publications
Research Activities:
My laboratory currently investigates the role(s) of adhesion molecules (in particular the beta3 integrin and GPIb alpha complexes) involved in clot formation as well as their implications for hemostasis (including bleeding disorders) and thrombotic diseases (ie. heart attack and stroke). The laboratory also studies allo- and autoimmune diseases related to bleeding disorders such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (FNAITP). These studies have been well funded by both internal and external granting agencies including Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada (HSFC), Canadian Blood Services (CBS) and Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), etc.
Platelet physiology and thrombosis: thrombotic diseases such as heart attack and stroke are the leading causes of mortality and mobility worldwide. We established an intravital microscopy thrombosis model at Harvard to study thrombus formation in real time in live mice. Through direct monitoring of platelet adhesion and aggregation in vivo, we were the first to observe that platelet aggregation and thrombus formation still occur in mice lacking both von Willebrand factor (VWF) and fibrinogen (Fg). This surprising discovery challenged the established theory of thrombosis that required VWF and Fg for thrombus formation and suggested that other unidentified molecule(s) may also be involved in thrombosis and hemostasis and may provide novel targets for anti-thrombotic therapies. My team is in the process of identifying these mystery molecules at St. Michael's Hospital using several state-of-the-art techniques such as proteomics and confocal intravital microscopy.
Platelet immunology and maternal immune response to fetal antigens: my laboratory recently published two important papers in blood investigation: 1) How ITP mediated by anti-3 integrin and anti-GPIb antibodies differ, finding that these two antibody specificities may respond to therapy differently. This has important implications for human ITP and potential screening of patients in order to successfully treat this disease. 2) The first animal model of FNAITP, characterizing the disease and its response to intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) therapy. Currently, the laboratory is studying the molecular and cellular basis for ITP, the maternal immune responses to fetal platelet antigens and the roles of anti-angiogenesis and apoptosis in the patho-progression of FNAITP.

Research Activities:
My major research interests relate to the long-term medical issues that are faced by renal transplant recipients and living kidney donors, which could in turn affect their kidney function and survival.  Specifically, my team is working on: (1) post-transplant hypertension: the role of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in defining the prevalence and refining the treatment of hypertension in recipients; (2) the role of both traditional markers (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes) and novel markers (e.g. C-reactive protein, microalbuminuria, uric acid) in cardiovascular disease in renal transplant recipients; and (3) the long-term outcomes of living kidney donors (incidence of hypertension, proteinuria, and chronic kidney disease). My group conducts a number of prospective and retrospective database reviews to describe associations among various markers of risk, defining their specific roles in the transplant population. I am also involved as a principal investigator in clinical trials of immunosuppressive drugs in renal transplant recipients.

Selected Publications
Research Activities:
My primary interest is stroke outcome and health services research in the field of cerebrovascular disease. Specifically, I have looked at the domains of stroke care delivery, prevention, and improved stroke recovery. Both my research training and publications reflect my longstanding interests in these 3 areas. The first includes the assessment of how organized inpatient care affects stroke outcomes. The second includes adherence to the guidelines and risk of stroke in selected populations. The last relates to a novel area: the use of virtual reality of stroke rehabilitation. More recently, we have taken it a step further by exploring the use of virtual reality with Nintendo Wii gaming technology in patients with recent strokes. To accomplish these tasks, I formed and led a working group on stroke outcome research involving many leading stroke researchers in Canada, and other specialists interested in stroke, called SORCan (Stroke Outcomes Research Canada). This has led to a series of published papers, and others being submitted or in press. Our work has been highlighted in two summary reviews on ‘Advances in Health Policy and Outcomes’ published in STROKE Journal (Rudd et al. Stroke 2009;40;e301-e304 and Williams et al. Stroke 2010;41: e77-e80).  SORCan has the potential to be expanded and make worldwide contributions. Some of my success in these areas resulted from this productive network of colleagues and researchers in the field.
		

Our research program includes four main areas: stroke outcome research, stroke epidemiology, stroke & health policy, and new emerging therapies in cerebrovascular disease. The ultimate goal of our program is to contribute with a better understanding of cerebrovascular disease and to improve the quality of care for stroke patients.

My research is aimed at understanding the cellular immune mechanisms responsible for generation of both auto- and allo-IgG antibodies that recognize platelet antigens. These mechanisms can be exploited to develop immune-specific therapies which suppress these clinically significant immune responses. We are interested in how platelet antigens are processed and presented by antigen-presenting cells to T lymphocytes and how these intracellular biochemical events control platelet immunity. The pro-inflammatory nature of platelets that may be responsible for adverse reactions from platelet transfusions is also of interest, particularly how platelet Toll-like receptor expression modulates innate immune mechanisms. We are also studying the mechanisms that intravenous gammaglobulin and anti-D preparations utilize to increase platelet counts in immune thombocytopenic disorders.

Selected Publications
Research Activities:
The overall focus of my group is  the physiology and pathology of kidney tubular epithelial cells. Our aim is to understand the molecular events whereby inflammation and cell stress alters functional properties of the tubular epithelium, and contribute to the initiation of kidney disease. Specifically, we are interested in exploring how epithelial intercellular junctions are regulated under normal and pathologic conditions and how junction disruption in the tubular epithelium contributes to the development of progressive kidney disease. Junctions are key structural elements of the epithelium. In fact, the very definition of epithelium is a tissue with tightly controlled intercellular junctions that form a permeability barrier and maintain polarized distribution of proteins involved in vectorial transport (reabsorption and secretion). Junction disruption and dysregulation leading to epithelial dysfunction is a common theme in various pathological states (e.g. diabetic nephropathy) contributing to loss of function and increased susceptibility to fibrogenic stimuli. Therefore insight into the molecular mechanisms of junction regulation and its disorder in various disease states is central for understanding epithelial physiology and pathology. Within this large topic, our current investigations are aimed at exploring the molecular pathways leading to activation of  the Rho family small GTPases, and understanding the role of these pathways in mediating junction disruption and other functional alterations induced by inflammatory stimuli.

Selected Publications
Research Activities:
We at the Risk Factor Modification Center, St. Michael’s hospital conduct research that focuses on the development of complementary and alternative therapies based on dietary fibre, whole grain and herbal medicine in the prevention and treatment of diabetes and heart disease. 

These include:
Viscous Fiber Blend: This blend is the result of over 20 years of intensive research. Based on clinical studies it has been demonstrated to simultaneously lower blood glucose, blood cholesterol, blood pressure, and improve appetite regulation in individuals with diabetes and metabolic syndrome, beyond medication. Dr. Vuksan holds the patent to the viscous fiber blend. 
Novel variety of an ancient oily-grain Salba (Salvia hispanica L.): Salba is the richest whole food source of dietary fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants. This grain is a uniquely rich nutrient source and supplement to the diet of individuals with type 2 diabetes on conventional therapy, and has been shown to improve major and emerging cardiovascular risk factors. More recently, a new study has shown that adding Salba to white bread reduces appetite in healthy individuals. The grain was traditionally used by Aztecs as food and remedy and was known as “Running Food”.
Ginseng root: During the last 15 years the research group has explored the role of different types of ginseng in glucose and diabetes control, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, and vasodilatation. Our research was the first study to demonstrate the glucose lowering effect of ginseng in humans. We were the first to demonstrate that ginseng could reduce blood glucose. This findings have generated major international and national interest from the press and public, including CNN, Time magazine, BBC and Prevention Magazine 

All of these evidence-based discoveries have been extensively tested in a series of acute and long-term randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials at the RFMC.  Although preliminary, we are encouraged by their results, and more trials are planned to be conducted. We believe we have begun to collect a solid body of preliminary evidence that can eventually generate evidence-based discoveries that could be used singularly or in combination to prevent and treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Research Activities:
My primary interest is in the area of acute kidney injury (AKI). In collaboration with nephrologists and critical care physicians who have a common interest in AKI, we have established the city-wide University of Toronto Acute Kidney Injury Research Group (TAKI). We have an active research program that is primarily devoted to randomized trials that will help define the optimal delivery of renal replacement therapy in AKI. We are currently operating a multicentre randomized trial comparing hemofiltration and hemodialysis in AKI. We are also utilizing observational data to answer questions in the field of AKI using both locally-collected and administrative datasets.
		

I am also involved in studies pertaining to patients receiving chronic dialysis. Specific interests include the management of disordered mineral metabolism and cardiovascular disease as well as the role of novel dialytic modalities. Our dialysis research group, in collaboration with colleagues in Cardiology, is currently conducting a study that is examining the cardiovascular impact of conversion to in-centre nocturnal hemodialysis.

Using molecular and cellular approaches, we are studying pancreatic islet function under physiological and insulin resistant conditions. In particular, we are investigating the molecular mechanism(s) of intra-pancreatic hormonal regulation, i.e., the cross-talk between the islet hormones such as the mechanism(s) by which insulin suppresses glucagon secretion in alpha cells. We are also interested in studying the mechanisms underlying the effect of growth factors on pancreatic beta cell growth. Using gene therapy and peptide therapy, we are developing new therapies for both type 1 and type diabetes.

Selected Publications
Research Activities:
The zebrafish has emerged as an important vertebrate model organism for genome-wide functional genomic studies including annotation of gene function, modeling human disease and drug discovery. Many molecular tools, such as transgenesis, gene trapping, gene knockdown and chemical genetic screen, are now available in zebrafish. Using these advanced methods and in collaboration with many other PIs, my laboratory is developing a few zebrafish projects: (1) We are conducting cardiovascular gene trapping to identify and mutate genes involved in zebrafish cardiovascular development. Characterization of novel gene mutations will provide insight into cardiovascular function and disease mechanisms; (2) We are performing large-scale chemical genetic screens in developing zebrafish embryos to identify small molecules modulating zebrafish angiogenesis. Pro-angiogenic compounds will be evaluated as potential drugs to facilitate tissue regeneration whereas the anti-angiogenic compounds may be developed as anti-cancer drugs; (3) Annotation of novel gene function by morpholino-based gene knockdown technology.  

My laboratory also has a number of mouse gene knockout projects to study: (1) the role of a novel phospholipase gene family (lpdl and lpdlr) in thrombosis; (2) the role of a putative tumor suppressor Chc1L in development of multiple myeloma and prostate cancer.

Research Activities:
I am currently involved in several multicentre clinical trials in orthopaedic sport medicine.  There is an ongoing investigation on ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon grafts.  In partnership with the Pan-Am Sports Medicine Clinic in Winnipeg, we are comparing the traditional trans-tibial technique for creating the femoral tunnel with a more novel ‘anatomic’ method utilizing an accessory anteromedial portal.

We plan to begin a randomized investigation comparing early range of motion following
multiligament reconstruction of the knee versus the traditional mandatory four weeks of immobilization.
Last fall I was awarded the Sandy Kirkley Grant by the American Orthopedic Society for Sport  Medicine.  With that, I will begin a trial on shoulder dislocations here at St. Michael's Hospital. This randomized investigation will compare two techniques for emergently immobilizing shoulders following primary dislocations.
