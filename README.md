Mechanize/Spreadsheet Demoes
=============

In here are just some quick ruby scripts I've written using Mechanize and Spreadsheet to scrape some Hospital Data for a friend.
Therefore it does reflect some real life uses for these libraries... all in a few lines :)
Should be noted that they're not well written, but they are good for reference if anyone needs help with use of spreadsheet/mechanize.
