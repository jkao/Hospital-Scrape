Mechanize/Spreadsheet Demoes
=============

In here are just some quick ruby scripts I've written using Mechanize and Spreadsheet to scrape some Hospital Data for a friend.
Therefore it does reflect some real life uses for these libraries... all in a few lines :)

I honestly think the scripts could be written a little better, but hey, I think it'll serve its purpose as a reference for people using the github search for Mechanize/Spreadsheet.
